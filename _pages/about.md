I am a second year PhD student at National University of Singapore, under a supervision of <a href='https://ilyasergey.net'>Ilya Sergey</a>. 

I am broadly interested in formal verification, programming languages, type theory, category theory and HoTT.

### Important fact

In general, people tend to use *Vlad* as a shortened version of my name. However, that is <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_(name)'>incorrect</a>. If you want to use **accurate** short forms for my name, they would be:
  * Vova (*Most common*)
  * Volodya (*Most formal*)
  * Mira (*Most unusual*)
  * Vovan (*Most informal*)
